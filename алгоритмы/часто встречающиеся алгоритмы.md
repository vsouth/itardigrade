# Top K largest elements
- solution 1
sort + take K first elements
Complexity: O(N logN) - bc of sorting
- solution 2
**min-heap of K elements**
Complexity: O(N logK)

# Sliding window
stack or array or smth else

# Backtracking
recursion

# Dynamic programming
function

# DFS & BFS
DFS:
- stack (LIFO)
BFS:
- queue (FIFO)

## Dijkstra's algorithm
closer to BFS? 
uses heap?
is a priority first alg?
for weighted graphs

## Topological sort
Directed Acyclic Graphs only!!!
